Description: YUI Test is a complete testing framework for JavaScript and Web
 applications. You can use the simple JavaScript syntax to write unit tests that
 can be run in web browsers or on the command line, as well as functional tests
 to be run in web browsers. Additional tools that build on top of the JavaScript
 library's core functionality allow integration with build systems.
